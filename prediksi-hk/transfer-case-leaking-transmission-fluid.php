Are you leaking fluid from the tranny or TC   which one is low on fluid when you check  My AW4 and NP231 is setup such that the male output from the tranny plugs into the female unit of the TC.  It seals the transfer case fluid from getting out.  Upon further diagnosis  the tech may find fluid leaking between the transmission and transfer case or from the left hand transfer case weep hole closest to the transmission. 5L 1.  Lubricate the seal lips with petroleum jelly or with transmission oil.  ugh.  Volvo automatic transmission fluid AT101.  Earlier this year we changed the fluid a put in new reline oil.  If the TC is not low  check the transmission fluid  its either of the two seals that are leaking for sure.  Failure to properly align the seal so that it seals on BOTH sides of the hole  vent  will cause the transfer case to leak fluid out of the vent assembly on the RH bearing retainer.  Jul 14  2013    leak between trans and transfer case 14 Answers.  I have an 07 EXL 4WD.  Any transfer case leak is a big leak when you consider the whole system only hold 2 quarts.  quot  They replaced the PTU and charged me  1485.  Before cranking it up I disconnected the positive battery terminal to reset the computer.  I  39 m curious if I were to replace the fluid with a heavier weight oil  maybe the leak would slow up  I know there are several who use a 75 90 gear lube in the transfer case  which is alot thicker than the reccomended lube. transfer case leaking transmission fluid<br><br>
