The proposed nbsp  graph based stereo matching  ZHMB11b   or for semantic segmentation  GAM13 .  Superpixel segmentation.  Segmentation is essential for image analysis tasks.  Our main contribution is to take the concept of  amp quot superpixel embedding amp quot  into consideration  which is formalized as a potential item for optimizing the In the survey of semantic segmentation  based on their supervision  the segmentation methods can be divided into three slices  fully supervised  unsupervised  and weakly supervised.  Automatically and ideally segmenting the semantic region of each object in an image will greatly improve the precision and efficiency of subsequent image processing.  To reduce the cost  the paper proposes a semantic candidate regions trained Superpixel segmentation is an image segmentation in which each region     superpixel     preferably forms a portion of an object or scene component rather than the whole  where each superpixel is preferably homogeneous with respect to certain features  e.  Hence if one semantic region is classi ed extremely poorly  since all classes are weighted equally  the segmentation score is pulled down.  In the semantic segmentation task  rather than finding bounding box for objects of a specified class  the goal is to find the boundaries of a target object at the pixel level.  produced superpixels can be easy to control.  The proposed algorithm consists of three stages.   2013    Additional superpixel features based on deep detectors.  UAVid 2020 version is online  Dataset download is available now  UAVid 2020 version has 42 sequences in total  20 train  7 valid and 15 test .  Also  features on superpixels are much more robust than features on pixels only.  Selvaraj  D.  It is worth noting that each segmentation is obtained independently from other ones.
