They have a cell wall made of chitin and polysaccharides.  Explore interesting facts about fungi.  The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as Ascomycota  or true Fungi.  Fungi are eukaryotic organisms distinct from plants and animals and members lineage are assigned to kingdom Eumycota  often called kingdom Fungi .  Moreover  fungi are found in small size and can reproduce both ways  sexually and asexually.  Fungi were once considered plants  however  they do not make their own food.  Two major groups of organisms make up the fungi.  Its hyphae penetrate both the roots of the plant and the corpse of the insect.  Phylum Zygomycota   the Bread Molds Rhizopus     black bread mold 2.

There are about 100 000 species of fungi that have been described  and it is estimated that as many as 200 000 more may await discovery.  multicellular and motile to move are common characteristics of the 5 kingdoms.  Algae and Plants used to be apart of Kingdom Plantae  but they arent anymore.   2011  described the  quot cryptomycota  quot  a potentially new phylum of organisms within the Kingdom Fungi.  Protists are a group of loosely connected  mostly unicellular eukaryotic organisms that are not plants  animals or fungi.  Beneficial Fungi.  Figure 1  Many plants depend on fungi to help extract nutrients from the soil.  Those believed to form a monophyletic lineage are assigned to kingdom Eumycota  often called kingdom Fungi .  ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF FUNGI In the older classification of organisms  there are basically five kingdoms according to Robert Whittaker  Animalia  Plantae  Fungi  Protista  and Monera.

Fungus is a member of a large group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds  British English  moulds   as well as the more familiar mushrooms.  Molds are filamentous fungi  The body is called thallus.  SURVEY .  The thallus is made of hyphae which are cyclindrical  tube like structure that elongates by growth at tip.  They have branched and septate mycelium.  For example  Cantharellus  Hypocrea  Stereum  and Trametes.  There are also many funguslike organisms  including slime molds and oomycetes  water molds   that do not belong to kingdom Fungi but are often called fungi.

The fungal kingdom is now recognised as one of the oldest and largest clades of living organisms.  Proitsta  now moving into the uni multi cellular category  is well known for being called the junk drawer kingdom.  Members of this very diverse kingdom are typically unicelluar and less complex in structure than other eukaryotes.

But some fungi are used for disease control in plants. 2 and 3.  Fungi diverged from a unicellular and flagellated organism nearly 1 billion years ago  becoming separate but still very closely related to the Kingdom Animalia.  The discovery that slow growing anaerobic fungi commonly exist in the gut of cattle has resulted in a wealth of information on the mechanisms of surviving in such environments.
