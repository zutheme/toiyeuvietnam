Gamma is done to artificially boost or increase image tonal data values before it is shown  in the image file .  So sometimes before you send the image to the display to the monitor you do what  39 s called a gamma correction.  When as we have seen  the picture is the same  there is only a pixel values unit conversion to allow the correct image rendering.  Gamma is a more technical term for describing the mathematical formula for converting a stored luminance value  say  in an image file  to from a raw light intensity value  say  in a monitor  scanner or camera .  Gamma affects black and white TV as well as color.  The use of modern digital cameras with on sensor dark current suppression  that means on sensor dark frame subtraction during the exposure     combined with modern raw converters that use lens profiles  that means flat field corrections on the linear raw data  and reading the hot dead stuck pixel list from the raw file to correct bad pixels means astrophoto image processing is By storing the images read by Pillow PIL  as a NumPy array ndarray  various image processing can be performed using NumPy functions.  images is used to realize CE of the bright images  and the gamma correction modulated for computer vision  pattern recognition and digital image processing. 0 gray level.
