systemverilog instantiation  One needs to indicate the top level module before synthesis.  An abstract class sets out the prototype for the sub classes.  Module  amp  Instantiation of Instances A Module in Verilog is declared within the pair of keywords module and endmodule.  Each time we instantiate a module  we create a unique object which has its own name  parameters and IO connections.  System Verilog classes can be type parameterized  providing the basic function of C   templates.   implicit port connections.   Instance arrays are part of the Verilog 1995 LRM.

To Instantiate a Verilog Module in a VHDL Design Unit Declare a VHDL component with the same name as the Verilog module  respecting case sensitivity  that you want to instantiate.  Create SystemVerilog port instantiation from port declaration.  SystemVerilog also includes covergroup statements for specifying functional coverage.  implicitinstantiation enhancements require The Verilog PLI provides hooks for registering callbacks at various times in the parsing of the netlist and the running of the simulator.  wire elements are used as inputs and outputs within an actual module declaration.  Example 11.  A wire definition in Verilog must follow this format  wire  lt wire name gt   The definition of the wire that we will use for this example is as follows  Structural Verilog descriptions assemble several blocks of code and allow the introduction of hierarchy in a design.
