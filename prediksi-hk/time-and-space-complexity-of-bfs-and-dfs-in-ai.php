Some applications of BFS include Finding connected components in a graph  Testing a graph for bipartiteness  Finding all nodes within one connected component and Finding the shortest path between two nodes.  In this algorithm  each vertex of the graph needs to be traversed once  and each neighbour of a vertex is traversed once.  BFS         .  It will go on until the last level has been reached.  Breadth first search  BFS  is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures.  We use Queue data structure with maximum size of total number of vertices in the graph to implement BFS traversal.  Complexity of Breadth First Search.  Time and space complexity are measured in terms of .  The space complexity is also .  For both search strategies  you must show the search tree diagram and the final path to reach the goal node  G .  The worst case time complexity will be O  b k  and space complexity will be O   bN   where N is the deepest level in the search space.  Key Differences Between BFS and DFS.  DFS  BFS ANSWER  Depth first search  DFS  is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.  BFS consumes too much memory.  DFS has small space requirements  linear in depth  but has major problems  Time complexity is O b d  and space complexity is O b d    where b is branching factor and d is solution depth  2 .

Do a DFS which only searches for paths of length 1 or less.  That means  totally it requires 4 bytes of memory to complete its execution.  DFS goes to the bottom of a subtree  then backtracks.  d  depth of the optimal solution.  BFS and DFS  Topological Sort  and new graph phenomena.  For uniform cost search  that is  h        0  and unequal arc costs  the complexity is 0   B C c    where C is the cost of an optimal solution and c is the Worst time complexity case  O V 2  Average time complexity case  O V 2  Best time complexity case  O V 2  Space complexity  O V 2  where V is the number of vertices.  Space complexity  the fringe needs to save information  in the worst case  of nodes.  Consider for example the algorithm DFS iterative described in Wikipedia  and suppose that you run it on a tree so that you don  39 t have to keep track of which nodes you have already visited.  It is not complete because it may take infinite loop to reach at the goal node.  5  Speed  BFS is slower than DFS.  It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead  if possible  else by backtracking.   complexity   nbsp  OHJ 2556 Artificial Intelligence  Spring 2012.  d   6 b   10 time   18 mins memory 111Mb d   8 time 31 hours memory 1 terabyte d   14 time   3500 memory   11 111 terabytes  1 exabyte  Time is horrible but space considerations are worse   Breadth first search  BFS  is an important graph search algorithm that is used to solve many problems including finding the shortest path in a graph and solving puzzle games  such as Rubik amp  39 s Cubes .  9   Note that this is not saying it  39 s space time complexity is optimal. cs.  A  is complete  optimal  and it has a time and space complexity of    92 mathcal O  b m  .  DFS and BFS time complexity  O n  Because this is tree traversal  we must touch every node  making this O n  where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  When the number of vertices in the graph is know ahead of time  and additional data structures are used to determine which vertices have already been added to the queue  the space of.  Space complexity refers to the proportion of the number of nodes at the deepest level of a search.  Below graph shows order in which the nodes are discovered in DFS     Iterative deepening uses DFS as a subroutine  1.  BFS stores the entire tree in memory  for a complete exploration .  An operator employed to generate all possible children of a node.  Then  a BFS would usually be faster than a DFS.  It doesn  39 t expand the rest like BFS.  Space complexity and Time complexity  Consider a state space where each node as a branching factor b  the root of the tree generates b nodes  each of which generates b nodes yielding b 2 each of these generates b 3 and so on.  The time and space complexity are measured in terms of  b  maximum branching factor of the search tree  actions per state .  BFS went from 1 to 10 in that order  while DFS went as deep as it could on each node.  The Breadth First Search BFS  is another fundamental search algorithm used to explore the nodes and edges of a graph.  Hence  we must apply the uniform cost search only if the state costs are different  and path costs are not a non decr ea sing function of depth.  The time complexity of BFS if the entire tree is traversed is O V  where V is the number of nodes.  DFS generate the same set of nodes as BFS   Time Complexity is O b d  The first solution DFS found may not be the optimal one.  When using data structures  if one more element is needed every time n increases by 1  then the algorithm will use O n Nov 26  2019    DFS is more suitable for decision tree.  BFS and DFS  both of the graph searching techniques have similar running time but different space consumption  DFS takes linear space because we have to remember single path with unexplored nodes  while BFS keeps every node in memory.     4.  Jan 17  2014    This is in contrast with breadth first search which requires more space.  May 14  2018    As you can see the graph is the same on BFS and DFS  however  the order how the nodes were visited is very different.  The reason for this is that when searching at level d  so generate all the successors into the fringe.
