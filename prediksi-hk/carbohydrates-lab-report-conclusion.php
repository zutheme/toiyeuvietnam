The chemical bonds in carbohydrates  fats  and proteins store energy until needed by the plant. It is used widely as compared to other tests because before every specific test for different carbohydrates a general test is important and that general test is performed via molisch test.  2.  232 . com Conclusion As can be seen from the table of results shown above  the  quot UNKNOWN quot  gave three positive results .  In conclusion  the results indicated that the participant   s VO2 max was 52.  1 gram of Sucrose in tube 1 would essentially have the same amount of carbon as 1 gram glucose placed into tube 2.  The volume of the acid is determined using a volumetric pipette and the burette used in the experiment has scale divisions every 0.  The theory for this concept is that if in the benedicts test the carbohydrate reacts  it is a monosaccharide.  In today   s lab  you will study carbohydrates  monosaccharides  disaccharides  amp  polysaccharides   proteins and lipids.  LAB 5.  This makes fat an excellent source of energy.
