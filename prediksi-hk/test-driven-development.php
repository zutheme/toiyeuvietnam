Environment for practicing Feb 19  2020    Test Driven Development is the process in which test cases are written before the code that validates those cases.  By validating them against a series of agreed to tests  TDD   an Agile Testing practice   improves system outcomes by assuring that the system implementation meets its requirements.  Each check in is then verified by an automated build  allowing teams to detect problems early.  With TDD  requirements are turned into very specific test cases  then the code is improved so the tests pass.  Metrics should be collected on a regular basis  so corrective action can be taken as soon as One of the key advantages of modularization is test driven development  TDD .  The book was fantastic and challenged the way that I thought about writing embedded software.  Most of us are following Agile methodology where we would like to test our code within code.

Test driven development is a balanced approach for the programming perfectly blended with tightly interwoven three activities  coding  testing  writing unit tests  and designing  refactoring .  First of all  the test is written and must fail at the beginning. test driven development<br><br>
