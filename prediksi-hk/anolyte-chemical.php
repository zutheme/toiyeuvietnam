How Electro Chemical Activation  ECA  Works The electrolyzed water anolyte solution is a proven method to disinfect without the use of harsh chemicals.  The electrochemical treatment of water by the electric current is a promising modern approach in the water disinfection technique  resulting in obtaining the electrochemically activated water solutions  catholyte anolyte  carrying new physical chemical properties stipulated by changing of the electrochemical characteristics of water as ORP  Eh  pH.  What is Eco Lyte  NTL  or Anolyte   Eco Lyte  NTL    is the worlds most effective NON CHEMICAL cleaning solution available and is used to eliminate all types of bacteria  micro bacteria  viruses  fungi  spores and microbial toxins. 5 molar in silver nitrate  and 0.  Safe water for your family  39 s good health. 5  mixture of salts and minerals  50 51 .  Anolyte is highly effective at breaking down biofilms that protect bacteria.  Chemical disinfections of water networks are control measures that need to be fine tuned to obtain satisfactory results in large buildings over prolonged time periods.  It is a highly effi cient  versatile and cost effective way to maintain health and hygiene standards throughout a hotel and in a way which is demonstrably environmentally sensitive.  High level of safety  no hazardous chemicals produced or used.  Materials If you have trouble finding the products you  39 re looking for  please contact our customer support for assistance.      Neutral Ph of Anolyte makes it completely safe and eco friendly while keeping its May 07  2020    Anolyte is a water based product that has been proven to have a powerful effect on killing previous variants of corona virus within 15 30 seconds.  Anolyte.  May 08  2020    While Chemical sanitizers  when available  do affect below the golden time need to eliminate the Covid 19  SanClean HOCL  Anolyte  has reported up to 300 times more effective than chemical sanitizers.  137 likes    13 talking about this. 5 and ORP  700mV    1200mV has a great biocide potential.  ANK Neutral Anolyte has no perfume agents  no colorings  no artificial scents  no added preservatives  no toxic chemicals and leaves no residual which makes it not only natural and safe  but also very cost UBS    new Electro Chemical Activation Technology  ECAT  Anolyte achieved a superior bacteria kill count when tested in the fracing process of 10 wells located in the Barnett Shale and West Texas Solid phase anolyte. 1200 .  Chemical Feed and Mixing Systems Ecologix chemical feed and chemical mixing systems are engineered to meet the requirements specific to your application. 5 and an Oxidation Reduction Potential  ORP  of  600 to  1200 mV.  Example   24 karat gold  NaCl  water  etc.  Anolyte with pH controlled in the range 2.  During Electro Chemical Activation  ECA  of water  a dilute saline nbsp  1 May 2020 A concentrated electro chemically activated solution rich in oxygen  in which pathogens such as bacteria and viruses cannot survive Powerful nbsp  Anolyte is a Hypochlorous acid disinfection liquid  which kills viruses in under 15 This process is chemically selective with no toxic or mutagenic side effects for nbsp  Anolyte as a    Lethal but Safe    Disinfectant and Sanitizer food producers are under increasing pressure to rid their operations of harsh and unsafe chemicals.  Water pipes and equipment don  39 t have to be rinsed with water after any disinfection process.  The EnviroNize   ULV Fogger has a wide array of applications  making it one of the most v Anolyte Disinfectant and Catholyte Detergent medium a technology has been around for 40 years and first developed by the Russians approximately 100 years ago.  Electrolyzed  EOW  water is generated by the electrolysis of a dilute NaCl solution interacting with an electrolytic cell.  anolyte and catholyte respectively.  Anolyte is the electrolyte on the anode side of an electrochemical cell that is divided into compartments.  Aquastar Coulomat C NC  and A NC are available if separate anolyte and catholyte reagents are preferred.  Common Name  Dilute Hypochlorous Acid.  Anolyte is the most effective Non Chemical disinfectant available and is used to address all types of bacteria  viruses  fungi  spores  and toxic microbial nbsp  Anolyte and Catholyte Solutions. D system utilized the unique ECA technology to produce a neutral anolyte solution which is a colourless transparent biocidical liquid with a slight chlorine smell.  ELECTRO CHEMICAL ACTIVATION  ECA  OF DILUTE HIGH PURITY BRINE.  we believe that the upstream oil and gas industry increasingly needs more than a provider of specialty chemical products to solve their unique and evolving production challenges     the industry needs production chemical solutions.  Anolyte doesn  39 t affect the original  natural properties of the water.  Neutral anolyte is very effective against bacteria and viruses and is mostly used to disinfect swimming pools  drinking water or other water sources.  Neutral anolyte does not cause any side effects on the quality of the silage  which is often the case when chemical preservatives are traditionally used.  Anolyte contains compounds and elements that are 100  environmentally friendly  nontoxic and biodegradable.  in biomedical sciences and is a science writer  educator  and consultant.  In order to generate electro chemically active  envoronmentally friendly  highly active solutions of anolyte or catholyte  a diluted saline solution is passed through a flow through electrolyzer. W ECA Generator Range.  For the anolyte they are   500    600 mV  and for pH  3.  Since no man made chemical compounds are involved  the ECA generated biocides are safe for plants  humans and the environment  with the Anolyte solutions reverting back into their natural state of salt water.  All disinfectant solutions are prepared by the VAST and ensure safety for sensitive skin areas.  Anolyte and Catholyte Solutions.  Contact CER. anolyte chemical<br><br>
