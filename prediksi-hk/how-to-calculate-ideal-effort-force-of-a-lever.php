Assume that she moves up at a constant speed.  Effort.  Remove I am thinking of the stairs as a  quot lever quot   where the lever itself is the  quot load quot   i.  If we ignore any friction that occurs where the lever pivots over the fulcrum  this is an ideal machine.  Third class lever  effort force is between the resistance force and fulcrum  doesn   t multiply force but does not increase distance over which force is applied.  2 gt  The Lever transforms the input force either by amplifying it or by changing its direction and exerts an output force.  The mechanical advantage of a machine is the ratio of the output force produced by a machine to the applied input force.  The type of lever depends on where the effort acts compared with the load and the pivot.  Thus a system consisting of a single lever subject to two forces F 1 and F 2 at distances x 1 and x 2 from the fulcrum is in equilibrium when F 1 x 1   F 2 x 2.  Mechanical advantage of a lever   Effort arm   Load arm The levers are of three kinds   2.  formula for IMA  length of effort arm divided by length of resistance arm when the effort force is ALWAYS multiplied  using a second class lever.  The above explanation is for the use of efficiency in physics and thermodynamics  but efficiency can be used in anything from finance to work performance.  12 m 37 m 30 m 24 m Another way to calculate mechanical advantage is  Mechanical advantage   Distance effort moves  cm  Distance resistance moves  cm  Both of these equations are for    ideal    mechanical advantage which means they are calculated value based on lever distance measurements rather than the actual forces  effort and resistance  used on the lever.  From torque equilibrium we see that a resistance force F r can be balanced by a smaller effort force F e    L r  L e F r.  The mechanical advantage can be calculated for the following simple machines by using the following formulas  Lever  MA   length of effort arm   length of resistance arm.  Simple Machines     Lever.
