If fewer samples are used to represent the signal  it is called decimation.  The decimator is utilized to nbsp  Fundamentally this modules provides classes to change the sampling rate by an integer factor  either up  interpolation or down  decimation  with integrated nbsp  From  R.  Multirate systems are. 1.  In particular it is shown that when systems for interpolation or decimation are implemented as multistage processes  highly efficient designs can be obtained.  filters used in multi rate processing.   4  Lyons  Richard G.  Defines a multistage filter and describes its uses.  There are many more to topics and techniques in multirate digital signal processing including  I Implementation techniques  e.  New building blocks in multi rate signal processing .  Multirate Digital Signal Processing Ronald E.  Decreasing the sampling rate is known as decimation.  Decimation  or downsampling  is the reverse operation of the sinc interpolation.  From the communications receivers and or transmitters point of view  they also offer an interesting alternative to mixing in performing frequency translations.  .  Crochiere Lawrence R.

Acoustics  Speech  and Signal Processing  Vol. 1 shows the two cases of the noble identity.  This filter  sometimes referred to as the Hogenauer Filter  can be used to implement efficient multirate decimation and interpolation filters for large IA digital signal processing system that uses signals with di erent sampling frequencies is probably performing multirate digital signal processing.

In digital signal processing  it is sometimes required to vary the sampling rate  for example  when information is shared between two processors which are working at different sampling rates  when scaling is applied two types of multirate filtering processes are decimation and interpolation.  5  OCTOBER 1975 Optimum FIR Digital Filter Implementations for Decimation  Interpolation  and Narrow Band Filtering RONALD E.

MULTIRATE SIGNAL PROCESSING.  Rabiner interpolation 230.  Upsampling can create imaging artifacts.  The use of this technique promises cheaper DSP hardware that dissipates less heat.  ICASSP 91.  In general  multirate filters are filters in which different parts of the filter operate at different rates.  DECIMATION BY A FACTOR D Let us assume that the signal x n  with spectrum XO  is to be downsampled by an integer factor D. Multirate Signal Processing Decimation and Interpolation Dr.  Module purpose  This introductory course in Digital Signal Processing explores mathematical tools used to represent  analyse and design basic DSP systems.  The operation of downsampling by factor M describes the process of keeping every Mth sample and discarding the rest.  Multirate filters alter the sample rate of the input signal during the filtering process.  x m     L y n  Multirate Filtering for Digital Signal Processing.
