If your RAM is rated for 2133 and you want to overclock to 2400  you should try increasing the frequency in steps.  I ran the memory diagnostic tool in Windows 8. I.  I  39 ve not had one dell told you the limit of what they sell  because of course they want you to buy ram from them not somewhere else    like literally dell only has ddr4 2133 ram so of course theyre not gonna be like go buy the 2666 from corsair Dec 02  2017    Making such a module run at 2666 MT s is a challenge  so they end up running at relatively high latencies  which are higher than CL17     CL20 specified by JEDEC for DDR4 2666 .  Dec 03  2016    Also note that CPU Z reading is the DRAM clock frequency.  I found a few posts showing that the 3200 only runs at that if it is overclocked to run at that otherwise it is going to run at 2133.

Ripjaws V is the company   s second generation DDR4 memory product  the new series brings more affordable prices and faster speeds  and redesigned heat sinks with poor heat dissipation. All of the memory in there is 3000 MHz or 2666 MHz minimum  For example  If there is a 2133 MHz chip in there for some crazy reason  the whole PC will run at 2133 MHz.  However  Windows  Task Manager  WMIC and CPU Z  still show it as 2133.  Since the CPU supports only DDR4 2133  you won  39 t be able to run the memory at DDR4 2400 no matter what   haven  39 t checked that on a X99 motherboard  but I assume it  39 s going to be the same    pick a DDR4 2133 kit and save some buckaroos.  DDR4 RAM will run at JEDEC DDR4 2133 speed at stock   default.  BIOS is set to profile 1 and speed shows as 2133 there as well as CPU Z.
