Suppose you are evaluating the product of coefficients test statistic computed with Aroian   s second order exact solution and that your sample size is approximately 200.  But the main contribution of Preacher and Hayes   2004   was to present SAS and SPSS syntax for an alternative    bootstrap    test of the indirect effect that is almost always more powerful than Sobel  39 s test.  I will use PROCESS a freely available macro for SPSS and SAS to show implementation of these analyses. 25  .  PROCESS for SPSS and SAS was written by Andrew F.  PROCESS can be used as either a command driven macro or installed as a custom dialog for setting up the model using SPSS   s point and click user interface.  and A.  We will choose the SPSS One Way ANOVA procedure to analyze our data.  Note  the Sobel test works well only in large samples.

One variation of the Sobel test subtracts the The Sobel test is more accurate than the Baron and Kenny steps explained above  however it does have low statistical power.  In the case of simple mediation  the Sobel test is conducted by comparing the strength of the indirect effect of X on Y to the point null hypothesis that it equals zero.  2016.   2004 .
