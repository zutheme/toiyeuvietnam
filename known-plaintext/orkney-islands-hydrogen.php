The large transport ferries using the hydrogen fuel in these tests  and the fact that the hydrogen is renewably generated instead of created with fossil fuels  are the factors that make Orkney electrolysis unique.  Apr 16  2020    The Orkneys are already 100  powered by renewable energy  and they are world leading pioneers in wave and tidal energy.  Apr 25  2019    Mr O   Connell said two years down the road in its research  Valentia is liaising directly with the community effort in Orkney.  The European Marine Energy Centre  EMEC   Orkney  Scotland  has joined forces with Perpetuus Tidal Energy May 15  2018    Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said     We are very supportive of the BIG HIT initiative because it will help alleviate grid constraints in the Orkney Islands by enabling excess renewable energy generated locally  but what cannot be transmitted to the mainland to be stored and used to produce hydrogen.  HyDIME  Hydrogen Diesel Injection in a Marine Environment  is a 12 month  Innovate UK funded project that will use an environmentally friendly form of hydrogen as a fuel for a commercial ferry operating between Shapinsay and Kirkwall in Orkney. 7million in September 2019 in The Orkney islands in far northern Scotland use excess wind power to produce the zero carbon fuel.

The HyDIME project will trial a hydrogen diesel dual fuel conversion system on board the MV Shapinsay.  A hydrogen powered fuel cell is now providing electricity to vessels that dock on one of the island   s piers.  Very few a have actually delivered hydrogen projects though  and even fewer have created a    hydrogen economy   . 7 million from state resources in September 2019.  Mar 06  2020    The Orkney islands in far northern Scotland use excess wind power to produce the zero carbon fuel.  Depending on how it goes  water power could be coming to a home  business  or even vehicle near you in the not too distant future     no matter where you are in the world.  The Orkney Harbours Masterplan Phase 1 considers five main locations on the island of Mainland.  They are ahead of the game on converting excess renewable energy into hydrogen  and hydrogen powered ferries are due to enter service in 2021.  Jun 22  2018    A hydrogen ferry was a hypothetic idea  at the beginning of the project.  The hydrogen generated is currently used for a variety of applications around the archipelago  including generating electricity for the boats docked in the harbour at Kirkwall  Orkney   s capital  generating electricity and heat for two small schools  and powering fuel cell range extenders on a small fleet of vans.  Once there  the hydrogen can be converted back into either heat or electricity for the harbour buildings  or for powering a fleet of zero emission hydrogen vehicles.  At the moment  2  of HySeas III is the final development stage of a programme to deliver what the consortium hopes will be the world   s first sea going vehicle and passenger ferry that will be fuelled by hydrogen produced from local renewable energy sources in and around the Orkney Isles     and hence the above    Zero Emissions    tag.

About the Project.  This is where the company   s partner EMEC In Orkney  the craggy and beautiful archipelago off the northeast coast of Scotland  an EU funded project called BIG HIT is doing just that  by converting excess energy from wind turbines on the islands of Eday and Shapinsay into hydrogen.  Orkney is already a net exporter of renewable energy  with over 100 per cent of the islands    yearly electricity demand met by wind  solar and wave and tidal generation.  Now  Orkney is hoping to use hydrogen fuel cells to power a seagoing vessel able to transport both goods and Set on the small Scottish archipelago of the Orkney islands  the project is going to demonstrate the possibility of comprehensively relying on hydrogen as a way to maximize the use of their renewable energy resources.  The project about producing  storing  delivering and utilizing the gas in heat and electricity production  as well as transportation  was inaugurated May 15 through 16  2018  in Kirkwall.  Managing the energy transition to achieve our climate change targets will require a huge effort  and bringing the oil and gas  and renewables sectors together in the HOP project Aug 28  2020    The Orkney Islands boast an abundance of renewable electricity  and have pioneered new ways to make use of the surplus on windy days.  With islands worldwide leading the charge in renewable energy transitions and smart technology  this latest project will go a long May 10  2018    The project therefore represents a blue print for renewable hydrogen deployment for island systems and new hydrogen territories. orkney islands hydrogen<br><br>
