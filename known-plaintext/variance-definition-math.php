It is similar in application to techniques such as t test and z test  in that it is used to compare means and the relative variance between them.  In statistics  the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.  Do scores tend to center around the mean or are they spread out  For example  take two data sets each with 7 scores ranging from 1 to 9 and a mean of 5.  To calculate variance by hand  you take the arithmetic difference between each of the data points and the average  square them  add the sum of the squares and divide the result by one less than the number of data points in the sample.  adj.
