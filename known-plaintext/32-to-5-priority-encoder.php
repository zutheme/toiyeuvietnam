Construct a 5 to 32 line decoder with four 3 to 8 line decoders with enable Design a 4 input priority encoder with four inputs and three outputs including the.  Similarly when the inputs are 0000  the outputs are not valid and I0 to I7 are active low input sources  I7 has the highest priority and I0 has the lowest priority. 3 5 volt logic levels.  38.  at the first I  39 v used 4 encoders and after that I put their output the input of the other tow encoders  but it doesn  39 t work correctly at all  A priority encoder has a priority function which allows it to produce an output corresponding to the highest order input. 32 to 5 priority encoder<br><br>
