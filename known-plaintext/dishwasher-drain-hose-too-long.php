Also used two ty wraps to hold the drain hose in place on the loop so it doesn  39 t hit the wiring  wiring connectors or any sharp edges.

Whether not washing properly or not draining water at the end of the cycle  most dishwasher issues can be fixed without too much fuss.  Well the drain hose included with the machine looks kinda short  for the machine fits into a bumpout in our kitchen so it fits at an angle to the sink.  The hose is too long for my situation  unfortunately hopefully that will work.  You did the right thing running the dishwaser drain line as high as possible first.   inside diameter  to assure proper draining. dishwasher drain hose too long<br><br>
