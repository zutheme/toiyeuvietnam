hocn bond angle 38 Use VSEPR to predict bond angles about each highlighted atom.  In this case that means that the negative charge will be on the Oxygen because Oxygen is more Mar 27  2020    CH2O has a central carbon atom that forms two single bonds with the two hydrogen atoms and a double bond with the oxygen atom.  Since it has three substituents  according to valence shell electron pair repulsion theory  they are arranged along the same plane at 120 degree angles from each other.
