The Scottish island of Orkney has initiated the first phase of the ReFlex Orkney project  which will create a Virtual Energy System  VES  turning Orkney into a    smart energy island.  A new    smart energy    project launched in Orkney could see the islands become a model for sustainable energy projects around the globe and    reduce and eventually eliminate the need for fossil fuels     according to the European Marine Energy Centre  EMEC .  Here  it became the world  39 s first offshore wave energy device to generate electricity into a national grid anywhere in the world.  Approximately 50 vehicles on the roads in Orkney are battery p Apr 03  2019    Once demonstrated and proven in Orkney  it is expected that the VES model and associated integrated energy service supply framework will be replicated in other areas across the UK and internationally  building long term export opportunities for the ReFLEX project partners and helping to create more flexible and renewable based energy systems. ON  started grid connected tests off Orkney in 2010.

The ReFLEX project wants to maximise the use of locally generated May 05  2020    An innovative new project to boost local renewable energy generation on the Orkney Islands has been launched.  The project  led by the university  will be supported by the Scotland 5G Centre in the development of a demonstrator that will create a virtual 3D environment that models Orkney and the different components in its energy system     from electric vehicles and domestic batteries  to generators and turbines.  The islands of Orkney  off the northern coast of Scotland  are closer to the Arctic Circle than to London.  The project aims to decarbonise Orkney   s energy system and increase the use of local renewable generation through the roll out of domestic and commercial batteries  up to 600 electric vehicles in Orkney and the introduction of a competitive local renewable electricity tariff.  The work will be carried out in partnership with the European Marine Energy Centre  EMEC  and the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of St May 05  2020    The project  led by Heriot Watt University   s ground breaking GRID facility and supported by the Scotland 5G Centre  will develop a demonstrator that will create a virtual 3D environment that models Orkney and the different components in its energy system     from electric vehicles and domestic batteries  to generators and turbines.  On the Island of Eday  there is often a surplus of renewable electricity which  instead of being wasted  is fed into an electrolyser sited at EMEC   s tidal test facility.  Sep 14  2020    For example  the Project Natick team selected the Orkney Islands for the Northern Isles deployment in part because the grid there is supplied 100  by wind and solar as well as experimental green energy technologies under development at the European Marine Energy Centre.  The Oyster 2 project is a closed loop system  using fresh water and requires a low Sep 20  2019    The Orkney Islands host some of the best wind resource in the world and we are delighted to have secured Contracts for Difference  CfD  for our Costa Head and Hesta Head projects.  But that high rate indicates this is a great deal riskier The project looks to harness surplus wind and tidal power to provide energy that can be used locally.
