All of the protocols in the TCP IP suite use what  39 s known as network byte order  which is the same thing as big endian  which is the same as MSB first.  enum combo  A   0b100010010000  B   0b001000100100  C   0b000010001001  D  0b100001000100  E  0b001000010001  F  0b010010000100  G  0b000100100001  23 is MSB in hexadecimal  it   s for Data 1  28 is LSB in hexadecimal  it   s for Data 2  10.  With that example  if working with 8 bit unsigned binary 42 is really 00101010  so the most significant bit is 0.  Then  the resulting number is 2 003 254 244  which is 01110111 01100111 00111011 11100100 in the binary number.  This conversion process is identical to the conventional SAR approach.  Due to the positional notation  the least significant bit is also known as the rightmost bit.  Use a Boolean control to allow for selection between LSB and MSB.  In binary terms  the MSB is the bit that has the greatest effect on the number  and it is the left most bit.  If I work in hex the data is represented as 3 and A660 respectively  if I input this into my hex calculator as 3A660 adding the MSB and LSB then change to decimal I get 239200 which is 239.  msb    lsb           cpu                 bit                                                 .
