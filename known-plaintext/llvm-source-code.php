This demo works by using parts of the LLVM toolchain  llvm dis and llvm as   compiled by emscripten from C   to JavaScript  to check the assembly for errors and pretty print it.  In the game industry it is common to build large projects with fewer modules to improve build times and allow inter module optimisations.  My best tip for finding things is to just do a full text search in the  quot include quot  and  quot lib quot  directories.  The Main function starts out by calling WaitForDebugger  .  Though it should work properly without VS environment variables  you may try to open cmake gui explicitly from VS developer commandline  x64  if you find cmake having trouble searching for your MSVC compiler.
