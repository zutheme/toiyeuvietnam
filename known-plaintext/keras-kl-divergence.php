It is written in Python and can be run on top of TensorFlow  CNTK  or Theano.  Mar 14  2019    The first term is the Kullback Leibler divergence between the variational distribution q w       and the prior p w  and is called the complexity cost.  We will illustrate with a few plots the influence of the KL divergence on the encoder and decoder outputs. 007771 step 8000  loss 0. add_loss NLL  and model. K.                     2.
