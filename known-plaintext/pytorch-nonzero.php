Initializing with a config file does not load the weights Because we are dealing with floating point numbers  we may still see a very small nonzero number due to quantization.  Similar to arithmetic operations when we apply any comparison operator to Numpy Array  then it will be applied to each element in the array and a new bool Numpy Array will be created with values True or False.   predicting two of the three labels correctly this is better than predicting no labels at all.  PyTorch is currently maintained by Adam Paszke  Sam Gross  Soumith Chintala and Gregory Chanan with major contributions coming from hundreds of talented individuals in various forms and means.
