Note  If the baking process uses more than the available GPU memory  the process might fall back to the CPU Lightmapper.  Is there any way to print the GPU usage while other code is running  R7 200 is not a card model  it  39 s the entire series.  So such usage significantly decrease video performance and video drivers strive never use shared memory. how to lower gpu usage<br><br>
