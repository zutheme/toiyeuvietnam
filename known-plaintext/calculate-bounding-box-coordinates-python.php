You should then calculate L2 loss for these coordinates with respect to the ground truth bounding box and add it to the loss you are already using for classification.  A box is then transformed into that new space.  A bounding box is a mechanism for describing a particular area of a map.  The user provides me with a coordinate point  10   5  and a radius of 23. 2151960928  9.  After getting the bounding boxes from the Mask RCNN  we will compute the Intersection over Union  IoU  on each pair of the bounding boxes and parking spot coordinates.  ct the width of an object surrounded by a bounding box. de See full list on thepythoncode.
